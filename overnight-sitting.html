    <h2>Peace of Mind for You and Your Pet</h2>
    <p.ðŸ’¤ Overnight Pet Sitting
Some pets feel safest and most comfortable in their own homeâ€”especially overnight. With Casey's Pet Sitting 4 U, your pets can enjoy the peace of staying in their familiar environment while still receiving the attentive care they need.

Our overnight pet sitting service is perfect for both dogs and cats who need companionship, routine, and supervision while you're away for a night, a weekend, or an extended trip.

Each overnight stay includes:
Evening and morning feedings

Walks or potty breaks

Litter box scooping and cleanup

Playtime, cuddles, and companionship

Medication administration (if needed)

Light home care (mail collection, plant watering, etc.)

Youâ€™ll enjoy peace of mind knowing that your pet is cared for by someone who treats them like family. We stay in your home to ensure comfort, security, and stability for your pets while maintaining their normal routine.

Rest easyâ€”Caseyâ€™s Pet Sitting 4 U has it covered while youâ€™re away.</p>
