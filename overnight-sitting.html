    <h2>Comfort, Care, and Peace of Mind</h2>
    <p>Some pets feel safest and most comfortable in their own home—especially overnight. With Casey's Pet Sitting 4 U, your pets can enjoy the peace of staying in their familiar environment while still receiving the attentive care they need.</p>

    <p>Our <strong>overnight pet sitting</strong> service is perfect for both <strong>dogs and cats</strong> who need companionship, routine, and supervision while you're away for a night, a weekend, or an extended trip.</p>

    <h3>Each overnight stay includes:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Evening and morning feedings</li>
      <li>Walks or potty breaks</li>
      <li>Litter box scooping and cleanup</li>
      <li>Playtime, cuddles, and companionship</li>
      <li>Medication administration (if needed)</li>
      <li>Light home care (mail collection, plant watering, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
