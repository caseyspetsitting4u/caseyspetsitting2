      <h2>Comfort, Care, and Peace of Mind</h2>
      <p>Some pets feel safest and most comfortable in their own home—especially overnight. With Casey's Pet Sitting 4 U, your pets can enjoy the peace of staying in their familiar environment while still receiving the attentive care they need.</p>

      <p>Our <strong>overnight pet sitting</strong> service is perfect for both <strong>dogs and cats</strong> who need companionship, routine, and supervision while you're away for a night, a weekend, or an extended trip.</p>

      <h3>Each overnight stay includes:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Evening and morning feedings</li>
        <li>Walks or potty breaks</li>
        <li>Litter box scooping and cleanup</li>
        <li>Playtime, cuddles, and companionship</li>
        <li>Medication administration (if needed)</li>
        <li>Light home care (mail collection, plant watering, etc.)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>You’ll enjoy peace of mind knowing that your pet is cared for by someone who treats them like family. We stay in your home to ensure comfort, security, and stability for your pets while maintaining their normal routine.</p>
