Testimonials
    
Casey is wonderful. She did a meet and greet with our dog first, made sure she got along with other dogs. She was able to watch her for a day just one week later and was really flexible with timing. When we picked up our girl, we could tell she was happy and she was way less anxious than when she is in the crate all day. I definitely recommend Casey for your fur babies!

  Casey takes awesome care of my two cats! They are both quite skittish, but Casey has won their trust. She's been super at keeping the house looked occupied when I'm away by bringing in the mail, changing lights on/off, whatever it takes. I recently had to have unexpected surgery and Casey agreed without hesitation to check on the cats with only 24 hours notice. Definitely the best pet sitter I've ever had!
