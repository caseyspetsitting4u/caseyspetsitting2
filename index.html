    <h2>Testimonials</h2>

    <p><strong>Casey is wonderful.</strong> She did a meet and greet with our dog first, made sure she got along with other dogs. She was able to watch her for a day just one week later and was really flexible with timing. When we picked up our girl, we could tell she was happy and she was way less anxious than when she is in the crate all day. I definitely recommend Casey for your fur babies!<br>â€“ Lara Truitt</p>

    <p><strong>Casey takes awesome care of my two cats!</strong> They are both quite skittish, but Casey has won their trust. She's been super at keeping the house looking occupied when I'm away by bringing in the mail, changing lights on/off, whatever it takes. I recently had to have unexpected surgery and Casey agreed without hesitation to check on the cats with only 24 hours notice. Definitely the best pet sitter I've ever had!<br>â€“ Linda Myers</p>

    <p><strong>This is a great place!</strong> From opening the door to meeting the sitter, my dog Charlie was very happy and wagging his tail. I was even impressed by how professional the staff was. I'm definitely going to be using this organization again. Thank you â€” 5 stars all the way!<br>P.S. Weâ€™ll be seeing you again real soon.<br>â€“ Terrance Thomas</p>
